# Given a nonnegative integer n, define 3 integers n*, n- and n+ as follows.
#
# Let n* be:
# - 0 if n contains no occurrence of an odd digit;
# - otherwise, the number consisting of ALL ODD DIGITS in n,
#   in INCREASING ORDER.
# For instance, if n is 29350459566388 then n* is 3355599.
#
# Let n- be n* with 1 replaced by 0
#                   3 replaced by 2
#                   ...
#                   7 replaced by 6
#                   9 replaced by 8
#   UNLESS n* starts with 1, in which case n- is 0.
# For instance, if n* is 3355599 then n- is 2244488.
#
# Let n+ be n* with 1 replaced by 2
#                   3 replaced by 4
#                   ...
#                   7 replaced by 8
#                   9 replaced by 0
#   UNLESS n* starts with 9, in which case n+ is 0.
# For instance, if n* is 3355599 then n+ is 4466600.
#
# Returns the triple (n*, n-, n+) as defined above.
# You can assume that n is a nonnegative integer.
